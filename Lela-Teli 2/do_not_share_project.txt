When a project folder contains this file, then that project will not be converted to the shared format (fwdb) when the "Share projects stored on this computer" check box is selected.
This file needs to be in place prior to selecting that setting in order to avoid sharing the project.
Sample projects have this file by default. If you delete this file from a sample project folder and then share your projects, you will end up with a non-shared version (fwdata) of the project when you next install FieldWorks.
